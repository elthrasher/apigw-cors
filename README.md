# API Gateway, CORS and Lambda Integrations

Looking at different ways to set CORS headers with API Gateway and Lambda integrations.

Helpful commands:

* `npm i` install dependencies
* `npm run synth` if you want to inspect a cfn template
* `npm run deploy` to ship it
* `npm run destroy` to clean up
